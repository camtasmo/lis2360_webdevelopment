    	<p>Amazon.com, Inc., or simply abbreviated as Amazon, is currently one of the largest, most successful corporations in the world, rivaling those of Google and Apple. Amazon is an American electronic commerce and cloud computing company founded by Jeff Bezos, who, due to the success of Amazon, is currently the wealthiest figure in the world. Amazon's vast influence over the interweb is astoundingly impressive, but it comes at a great cost. Like a chocolate milkshake placed in the middle of a room full of hungry, sugar-addicted children, Amazon attracts multitudes of cyber criminals every day that go after the company looking to compromise users in a variety of ways, whether it is spying on them, re-routing their purchases, or stealing valuable information from them such as their credit card info or addresses. Because of this, Amazon requires top-notch cybersecurity to deter hackers, as do all big-name corporations. However, Amazon has taken a greater step in the realm of cybersecurity with its addition of a computing service known as Amazon Web Services, or AWS for short. Although not a cybersecurity service in and of itself, many believe that AWS is still a very important step for the future of cybersecurity. However, some think that it may just be its downfall.</p>

        <h1>AWS's Impact on Cybersecurity</h1>
    
    	<p>Amazon's creation of the AWS was a milestone in cloud computing. For the uninitiated, AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that instantly provides cloud computing platforms to anyone, including whole governments or companies, on a paid subscription basis. Now, how does this have anything to do with cybersecurity, you may ask? Due to Amazon's worth, and in turn AWS's worth, AWS is capable of buying out most cybersecurity firms and programs, including the high-end ones that have already made names for themselves. One of the most recent purchases of this kind made by AWS was the purchase of Harvest.ai, which is a cybersecurity program completely ran by artificial intelligence. The purchase was a hefty $19 billion, but AWS was happy to oblige. AWS continues to purchase various cybersecurity initiatives both large and small, and this rapidly-expanding cybersecurity empire AWS is creating points to a strong future for cybersecurity. This practice allows for the creation of exceptionally powerful cyber defenses, defenses that will soon serve as the leading image of cybersecurity. Depending on how successful these practices become, cyber crime could possibly drop considerably, which will mean more confidence in corporations, businesses and individuals using the internet for e-commerce, stock, or any other personal reasons.</p>

        <p>Although the practice set forth by AWS of buying cybersecurity companies and programs points to a more fortified future in cybersecurity, it also points to a disturbing one. It is true that there is no better strategy for creating the strongest cyber defense possible than to buy out and absorb every single cybersecurity company that catches your eye, but when other large corporations inevitably follow suit, the future of cybersecurity may just become one where the largest, most powerful corporations own all of the cybersecurity initiatives. This spells disaster for small startup cybersecurity companies. Startup companies will potentially be competing against strong corporations, and hence be at an extremely major disadvantage, when it comes to pitching their services and ideas to potential buyers. Most buyers will go with the side that has the most backing and the biggest name for itself, which makes startup companies virtually hopeless when it comes to trying to grow and expand their services and clientele. Besides being out-competed, there is also the high risk of startup companies being bought out altogether, which can possibly put a permanent halt on their growth and progress. Even if the future's cyber defenses will be stronger than iron, is it really worth it when the younger, less developed companies get to die out or conform as a result?</p>

        <h1>The Cyber Industry's Future</h1>
        
    	<p>How the future of cybersecurity will end up playing out is ultimately unknown, but if practices continue to advance in the direction they are currently advancing in, the future could be bleak for small businesses and startups. The internet is supposed to be a place where people can freely express their opinions, ideas, and business practices, but if big name corporations slowly occupy the entirety of it as if they are conducting some kind of digitalized war over territory, people attempting to make something of their lives out of utilization of the internet will ultimately be compromised. The biggest, wealthiest tech corporations and their subsidiaries will thrive off of the expense of the youger, weaker cybersecurity companies that do not have the financial backing available to protect themselves. Now imagine if this were to expand beyond just cybersecurity initiatives and involve other types of businesses as well: is that truly the bright future of business that we originally envisioned?</p>
